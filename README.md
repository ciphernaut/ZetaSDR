# ZetaSDR

ZetaSDR is an agentic RF runtime: a node that owns signal sources, keeps a live picture of the
spectrum and exposes "what is there, what is it, decode it" as typed operations that a human, a
script or an LLM can invoke. This branch is the core node: ports and leases, IQ ring, stream bus,
jobs, the operation set, a SigMF file source and the `zeta` CLI.

Design: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-zetasdr-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-zetasdr-design.md).
Plan: [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-18-core-node.md](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-18-core-node.md).

## Tests

The toolchain is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.97); install `rustfmt` and `clippy` for it
(`rustup component add rustfmt clippy --toolchain 1.97`), then:

```bash
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace
```

### GPU backend

The FFT stage has a GPU implementation behind the `gpu` cargo feature (wgpu compute shader;
`cargo build -p zeta --features gpu`, tests with `cargo test -p zeta-dsp --features gpu`). With
the feature on, the node adds the GPU backend only when a hardware adapter is found, and the
scheduler then prefers it; without one the CPU FFT runs, so a missing GPU never fails a job.
`gpu_matches_cpu_within_0_1_db` needs a GPU host: elsewhere it prints `skipped: no adapter` and
passes. Software adapters (lavapipe, llvmpipe) are ignored unless `ZETA_GPU_ALLOW_SOFTWARE=1`;
`software_adapter_allowed_by_env` sets it, so a GPU-less box with Mesa still runs the GPU path. A
GPU failure at run time is logged to stderr and that spectrum is computed on the CPU.

## CLI walkthrough

One-shot commands open the node, apply one operation, persist and exit; they do not resume jobs.
`zeta serve` resumes persisted jobs and keeps them running until Ctrl-C. A one-shot `iq read` or
`classify` waits (up to 5 s) for the source ring to cover the requested span. File sources play in
real time and loop. `--source-file` is not persisted: pass it on every invocation.

While `zeta serve` runs it holds `serve.lock` (its pid) in the state directory, and the mutating
one-shot commands (`job start`, `job stop`, `graph put`, `source ensure`) exit 2 with
`{"error": "other", "message": "zeta serve (pid N) owns this state dir"}`. A lock whose pid is no
longer alive is treated as stale. Liveness is checked through `/proc/<pid>`, so this is Linux only.

```bash
cargo build -q -p zeta
cargo run -q -p zeta-source-file --features test-fixtures --example gen_tone -- scratch/fx
A="--state-dir scratch/state --source-file tone=scratch/fx/tone.sigmf-meta"
./target/debug/zeta $A source list
./target/debug/zeta $A job start --kind passthrough --source tone --center-hz 100000000 --bandwidth-hz 48000
./target/debug/zeta $A job list
./target/debug/zeta $A iq read --source tone --start-ns 0 --end-ns 1000000000 --center-hz 100000000 --bandwidth-hz 48000
ls scratch/state/captures               # a .sigmf-meta / .sigmf-data pair
./target/debug/zeta $A job stop --job <id from job start>
./target/debug/zeta agents-md            # the agent guide, rendered from the operation schema
```

`AGENTS.md` is generated from the operation schema by `zeta agents-md`; `zeta agents-md --check`
fails if the committed file has drifted.
