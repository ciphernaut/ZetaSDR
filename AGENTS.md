# ZetaSDR agent guide

ZetaSDR is an agentic SDR runtime. You drive it through a small typed operation set. The CLI form and the JSON form of every operation are equivalent: `zeta <group> <verb> --flag value` and `{"op": "<name>", ...}` do the same thing.

## Rules

- One unit per field: frequencies and bandwidths are integers in hertz in fields ending `_hz`, rates are in baud in fields ending `_baud`, times are integer nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch in fields ending `_ns`, durations are integer milliseconds in fields ending `_ms`.
- Every field is required and unknown fields are rejected.
- Call operations, do not explain.
- Errors carry `error`, the offending `field`, the acceptable range and, when the value looks like dropped zeros, `suggested`. Use it.
- Unknown signals are reported as unknown, never guessed.
- Ids are never invented: `source` values come from `source list`, `job` values from `job list`.

## Running the node

Every command takes these global flags:

- `--state-dir PATH`: where jobs and captures persist (default `$XDG_STATE_HOME/zetasdr`, else `~/.local/state/zetasdr`). Pass the same directory on every invocation.
- `--source-file ID=PATH.sigmf-meta`: attach a SigMF recording as source `ID`.
- `--source-kiwi ID=HOST:PORT[/PASSWORD]`: attach a KiwiSDR receiver (0-30 MHz, at most 12 kHz wide) as source `ID`; the port is required and the password is never printed. Without `/PASSWORD` the password comes from `ZETA_KIWI_PASSWORD_<ID>` (`ID` upper-cased, other characters as `_`), which keeps it out of `ps`; the flag wins when both are given.
- `--source-node ID=SOURCE@URL[,max_bandwidth_hz=N]`: use source `SOURCE` of another ZetaSDR node, `URL` being its `http://HOST:PORT` (a `zeta serve --listen` node), as source `ID`. The node's secret comes from `ZETA_NODE_SECRET_<ID>` (`ID` mapped as for Kiwi passwords) and is never printed; without it the command is a usage error (exit 1). A remote source ships narrowband by default: `bandwidth_hz` is capped at 250 000 Hz (or the remote source's own maximum when smaller) unless `max_bandwidth_hz=N` (1-20 000 000) widens it explicitly. Each tune holds a `passthrough` job on the other node, so its `source list` and `job list` show who is using the source; the job is stopped when the tuning changes or this process exits normally (a killed process leaves it running; stop it there with `job stop`).
- `--source-vrt ID=udp://ADDR:PORT`: receive VITA 49.2 (VRT) packets, one per UDP datagram, on `ADDR:PORT` as source `ID`; `ADDR` must be a LAN address (`0.0.0.0` listens on every interface). The sender sets the frequency and rate: a job's band must lie inside the sender's last context packet (`source list` shows it as `current`; a job started before any context packet waits up to 1.5 s for one), otherwise the job fails with `unsupported` saying where the sender is; retune the sender, not the job. Packets that do not decode are skipped.
- `--source-soapy ID=ARGS`: attach a SoapySDR device as source `ID`, `ARGS` being SoapySDR device arguments such as `driver=hackrf,serial=...`; `zeta soapy find [--filter ARGS]` lists the devices attached to this machine as JSON. Only in a zeta built with `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg soapy"` (needs libsoapysdr-dev); otherwise both exit 1 saying so.
- `--plugin KIND=PATH`: register the program at absolute `PATH` as stage kind `KIND` (lowercase, not a built-in kind). It is probed at startup; a failed probe exits 1 naming the kind and the reason. A plugin runs with a cleared environment: only `PATH`, `HOME`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, `TERM` and `PYTHONPATH` pass through, and each `ZETA_PLUGIN_ENV_<NAME>` variable reaches it as `<NAME>`; nothing else (no `ZETA_SECRET`) does.

Sources and plugins are not persisted: repeat the flags, with the same ids and kinds, on every invocation, `serve` included. A source id may be used once across all the source flags. `source list` shows each source's capability record: `remote` is true for a KiwiSDR, a `--source-node` and a `--source-vrt` source, `push` false for SoapySDR devices, and `fault` names a source that has failed (a full Kiwi, an unplugged device); a job on a faulted source fails with that reason.

There are two ways to run:

- One-shot, `zeta <group> <verb> ...`: opens the node, applies one operation, prints the JSON result and exits (0 on success, 2 with a JSON error). It never resumes jobs: a job started one-shot is persisted as `running` and runs once `zeta serve` starts. `job start --then-tail MAX_FRAMES,TIMEOUT_MS` keeps that one-shot node up after the start, tails the job's first event stream (else its audio stream), then stops the job and prints `[job_result, frames_result, {"stopped": true}]`; add `--keep` to leave it running (`{"stopped": false}`). If the job is not running (e.g. failed) it prints `[job_result, job_record]`, the record's `state` carrying `status` and `reason`, and exits 2; `stream tail` on its own only sees streams of jobs running in the same process. A one-shot `iq read` or `classify` reads the ring that the command itself fills from the source, waiting up to 5 s for it to cover the span. One-shot commands, like `zeta serve`, start and probe every `--plugin` program at startup, so with plugins configured even a one-shot `source list` costs one process start per plugin.
- `zeta serve`: resumes persisted jobs and keeps them running until Ctrl-C.
- Against a running node, `zeta --node URL --secret SECRET <group> <verb> ...` (or the `ZETA_NODE` and `ZETA_SECRET` variables): the operation is sent to that node over HTTP and applied there, so jobs started this way keep running; `--state-dir`, the `--source-*` flags and `--plugin` belong to the serving node and are rejected (a usage error, exit 1). `zeta soapy find` always runs locally. `--then-tail` is not supported with `--node` yet (a usage error, exit 1): start the job, then `stream list` and `stream tail` against the node. Start that node with `zeta serve --listen PORT` (binds 127.0.0.1) or `--listen ADDR:PORT` (a LAN address) and a secret. `zeta-mcp --node URL` offers the same operations as MCP tools, and `zeta ask "REQUEST"` lets a local model call them.

While `zeta serve` runs it owns the state directory (it holds `serve.lock` there). Mutating one-shot commands (`job start`, `job stop`, `graph put`, `source ensure`) are then refused with an `other` error naming the server's pid; read-only commands still work. Use `--node` to change a node that `zeta serve` owns.

## Operations

### source_list

List the sources: id, capabilities, `current` band, `holders` (job ids) and `fault`, the source's unrecoverable failure (`null` when healthy). Jobs on a faulted source fail with `source ID: FAULT` as their reason; a successful tune (`source_ensure`, `job_start`) clears it.

JSON: `{"op":"source_list"}`

CLI: `zeta source list`

### source_ensure

Check a band against the source and tune it if no job holds it. Takes no lease: an unheld source is tuned directly (a later `job_start` may retune it); a held source is never retuned, and the request either fits the current band (`Tuning`) or is a `Conflict`. Runs under the lease manager's per-source gate, so it never interleaves with a job's lease-and-tune.

- source: string; an id from `source list`
- center_hz: integer (Hz)
- bandwidth_hz: integer (Hz)

JSON: `{"op":"source_ensure","source":"<id>","center_hz":144800000,"bandwidth_hz":12500}`

CLI: `zeta source ensure --source <id> --center-hz 144800000 --bandwidth-hz 12500`

### job_start

- kind: string (JobKind: passthrough|spectrum|fm_demod|aprs_decode|measure)
- source: string; an id from `source list`
- center_hz: integer (Hz)
- bandwidth_hz: integer (Hz)
- deviation_hz: integer or null

JSON: `{"op":"job_start","kind":"passthrough","source":"<id>","center_hz":144800000,"bandwidth_hz":12500,"deviation_hz":null}`

CLI: `zeta job start --kind passthrough --source <id> --center-hz 144800000 --bandwidth-hz 12500`

`deviation_hz` is the FM peak deviation for `fm_demod` (100-75000 Hz; `null` means the default, 5000 Hz, right for standard voice FM; use 2500 for narrow 12.5 kHz channels). Every other kind takes `null`. On the CLI, omit `--deviation-hz` for `null`.

### job_list

JSON: `{"op":"job_list"}`

CLI: `zeta job list`

### job_stop

- job: string; an id from `job list`

JSON: `{"op":"job_stop","job":"<id>"}`

CLI: `zeta job stop --job <id>`

### job_context

- job: string; an id from `job list`

JSON: `{"op":"job_context","job":"<id>"}`

CLI: `zeta job context --job <id>`

### iq_read

Save a selection under `state_dir/captures`: writes the whole ring bandwidth over the span as a SigMF pair; the selection band is recorded as an annotation. The capture is labelled with the ring's centre, and the selection band must lie inside the ring's band.

- selection: object (Selection: source, span{start_ns,end_ns: integer (ns since epoch)}, center_hz, bandwidth_hz)

JSON: `{"op":"iq_read","selection":{"source":"<id>","span":{"start_ns":1760000000000000000,"end_ns":1760000001000000000},"center_hz":144800000,"bandwidth_hz":12500}}`

CLI: `zeta iq read --source <id> --start-ns 1760000000000000000 --end-ns 1760000001000000000 --center-hz 144800000 --bandwidth-hz 12500`

### stream_list

List the streams: id, kind and provenance. One is always the node's own `ops` event stream (provenance source `node`): one event per applied operation with its outcome, logged after the operation completes.

JSON: `{"op":"stream_list"}`

CLI: `zeta stream list`

### stream_tail

Collect frames from a stream until `max_frames` (1..=1000) arrive or `timeout_ms` (1..=10000) passes, whichever is first; frames published before the call are not seen. Frames skipped because the caller fell behind are dropped and counted in the result's `missed`.

- stream: string; an id from `stream list`
- max_frames: integer
- timeout_ms: integer

JSON: `{"op":"stream_tail","stream":"<id>","max_frames":1,"timeout_ms":5000}`

CLI: `zeta stream tail --stream <id> --max-frames 1 --timeout-ms 5000`

### graph_get

- job: string; an id from `job list`

JSON: `{"op":"graph_get","job":"<id>"}`

CLI: `zeta graph get --job <id>`

### graph_put

Replace a job's graph; restarts a running job under the same id with the new graph.

- job: string; an id from `job list`
- graph: object (Graph: id, nodes[Node: id, kind, params], edges[Edge: from, to, kind])

JSON: `{"op":"graph_put","job":"<id>","graph":{"id":"<id>","nodes":[{"id":"<node-id>","kind":"passthrough","params":{"kind":"iq"}}],"edges":[]}}`

CLI: `zeta graph put --job <id> --file graph.json`

Fetch the current graph with `graph get`, edit it, and put it back; stage kinds and their params are listed under Stage kinds below and by `schema`.

### knowledge_lookup

Band-plan allocations in `region` and known signatures overlapping the band, from every registered knowledge provider.

- region: string; free-text region code such as `AU`
- center_hz: integer (Hz)
- bandwidth_hz: integer (Hz)

JSON: `{"op":"knowledge_lookup","region":"AU","center_hz":144800000,"bandwidth_hz":12500}`

CLI: `zeta knowledge lookup --region AU --center-hz 144800000 --bandwidth-hz 12500`

The built-in provider has signatures but no allocations, so an empty `allocations` list means no provider data, not nothing allocated.

### classify

Run every registered classifier over the selection's band and span of the source ring (no upstream features).

- selection: object (Selection: source, span{start_ns,end_ns: integer (ns since epoch)}, center_hz, bandwidth_hz)

JSON: `{"op":"classify","selection":{"source":"<id>","span":{"start_ns":1760000000000000000,"end_ns":1760000001000000000},"center_hz":144800000,"bandwidth_hz":12500}}`

CLI: `zeta classify --source <id> --start-ns 1760000000000000000 --end-ns 1760000001000000000 --center-hz 144800000 --bandwidth-hz 12500`

### schema

JSON: `{"op":"schema"}`

CLI: `zeta schema`

## Stage kinds

A graph node's `kind` names one of these; its `params` must match the listed fields.

### aprs_decode

- inputs: audio
- outputs: event

### channel

- inputs: iq
- outputs: iq
- params.center_hz: integer
- params.bandwidth_hz: integer
- params.out_rate_hz: integer

### fft

- inputs: iq
- outputs: event
- params.size: integer
- params.window: string (Window: hann|rect)

### measure

- inputs: iq
- outputs: event
- params.bandwidth_hz: integer or null

### nbfm_demod

- inputs: iq
- outputs: audio
- params.deviation_hz: integer
- params.audio_rate_hz: integer

### passthrough

- inputs: iq, audio, video, text, event, sink
- outputs: iq, audio, video, text, event, sink
- params.kind: string (StreamKind: iq|audio|video|text|event|sink)

## Field craft

Measured facts first, then method. Verify against the node's `knowledge lookup` before relying on any of this.

### Where to look

- Radiosondes: 400-406 MHz. RS41 is GFSK at 4800 baud, about 10 kHz wide.
- APRS: 144.800 MHz in AU and EU, 144.390 MHz in the US. AFSK at 1200 baud.
- POCSAG: the preamble is 576 bits of alternating 1/0, then the 32-bit sync word 0x7CD215D8. Common rates are 512, 1200 and 2400 baud.
- ADS-B: 1090 MHz, PPM at 1 Mbaud, 112-bit extended squitter.
- MeshCore: LoRa around 915 MHz in AU and 869 MHz in EU, 250 kHz wide. Not decodable without the network key; classify and report, do not try to decode.

### Decoding APRS and reading measurements

To decode APRS from a source, start the job and tail its events in one call: `zeta job start --kind aprs_decode --source S --center-hz 144800000 --bandwidth-hz 12500 --then-tail 1,5000`. It prints `[job_result, frames_result, {"stopped": true}]` (the job is stopped after the tail; add `--keep` to leave it running); each frame's `payload` is one decoded packet (`src`, `dst`, `info`, `fcs_ok`). An empty frame list means no packet arrived within the timeout, not that none exist. Exit 2 with `[job_result, job_record]` means the job is not running: read `state.reason` (e.g. a stage that failed on the source's blocks). A `measure` job emits one event per second of IQ: `center_hz` and `bandwidth_hz` are the occupied band (spectrum bins at least 6 dB above the noise floor, the 15th-percentile bin of the band), `snr_db` is the peak above that floor, `burst` is true when the loudest 10 ms is more than 3 times the median 10 ms power, `symbol_rate_baud` is the keying rate when a symbol-rate line stands out and `null` otherwise, and `label.name` is one of `noise` (SNR under 6 dB), `carrier` (steady envelope, no modulation), `fm` (steady envelope with deviation), `fsk` (two tones 500-3000 Hz apart, on RF or in FM audio) or `unknown`. Report `unknown` as unknown, with the measured fields. `classify` and `measure` analyse only the selection/job band (a `measure` event's `center_hz` is absolute RF, within that band); `spectrum` covers the whole source band.

### Remote HF receivers (KiwiSDR)

A KiwiSDR source covers 0-30 MHz and delivers 12 kHz of IQ per connection, so `bandwidth_hz` is at most 12 000: work one HF channel at a time with `measure` jobs or `classify` selections inside the band you tuned (e.g. 7 100 000 Hz with 10 000 Hz for 40 m), not wide `spectrum` sweeps. A Kiwi has a limited number of user slots; when they are all taken the source faults with `too_busy` and the job fails with that reason: report it, do not retry in a loop. The connection opens on the first tune and holds a slot until the node exits. Reception is site-dependent: the receiver's location, antenna, local noise and the time of day decide what is audible, so an empty band on one Kiwi says nothing about the band elsewhere.

### Sources on another node (federation)

A `--source-node` source is a receiver attached to another ZetaSDR node, typically a Raspberry Pi at the antenna. That node ships narrowband IQ by default (250 kHz at most), which a LAN or WiFi link carries comfortably: work one channel at a time with `measure`, `aprs_decode` or `classify` inside it. Widen it only when the job needs it, with `max_bandwidth_hz=N` on the flag, and expect a slow link to drop blocks rather than slow down. A `bandwidth_hz` over the cap is `out_of_range` with `suggested` set to the cap. Each tune runs a `passthrough` job on the remote node, so that node's `source list` and `job list` show the source as held: another caller there sees the lease conflict instead of a silent retune. If the remote node goes away, the local source faults naming its URL and the job fails with that reason: report it, do not retry in a loop.

### External stages

A plugin registered with `--plugin KIND=PATH` is a stage kind like any other: it is listed in `schema` under `stages` with its `params_schema`, and you use it by adding a node of that `kind` to a job's graph with `graph get`, edit, `graph put`. No job kind starts it on its own. A plugin that crashes or misbehaves fails its job with a reason naming the plugin.

### Working layer 4

When a signal has no known decoder, work it in this order:

1. Isolate the channel.
2. Resample to a rate suited to the symbol rate.
3. Recover the clock.
4. Slice symbols.
5. Inspect the bit stream.
6. Hypothesise framing (preamble, sync word, length, checksum).
7. Attempt a decode.
8. Write the result back as a signature, so the next encounter is a layer 2 match.

### The rule

When nothing matches, say "unknown" and report the measured features (centre, bandwidth, modulation, symbol rate, burst timing). Do not guess.
